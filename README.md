<h1 align="center">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p align="center">A while ago i found an old tablet of mine and decided to use it for a photo frame that also shows the time and date. In the end showing the time and date became its main purpose.The apps on the play store were not tailored for my need so i made my own app in unity.The app has two windows , one for time and one for calendar and also a battery indicator.</p>
